# FireSmokeDetection
Recent advancements in embedded processing have allowed vision-based systems to detect fire using Convolutional Neural Networks during surveillance. In this article, two custom CNN models have been implemented for a cost-effective fire detection CNN architecture for surveillance videos. The first model is a customized basic CNN architecture inspired by AlexNet architecture. We will implement and see its output and limitations and create a customized InceptionV3 model. To balance the efficiency and accuracy, the model is fine-tuned considering the nature of the target problem and fire data. We are going to use three different datasets for training our models. Letâ€™s get to the coding part.
